
## Analyse A/B Test Results

This project was submitted for the Practical Statistic element of Udacity’s Data Analyst Nanodegree.

### Project Requirements:

  * A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.
  * For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Project Specification:
  * Functionality of code - All code cells can be run without error.
  * Use of Good Coding Practices - Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.
  * Correct Interpretation of Results - All results from different analyses are correctly interpreted.
  * Correct Values for All Statistical Results - For all numeric values, you should provide the correct results of the analysis.
  * Statement of Conclusions - Conclusions should include not only statistical reasoning, but also practical reasoning for the situation.

### Datasets:
  * ab-data.csv
  * countries.csv
